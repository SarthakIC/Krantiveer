# Patient Centric Data Management System

This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms and BlockChain to predict diseases from symptoms and store the confidential data on Metamask Wallet. 

### Algorithms Explored

The following algorithms have been explored in code:

1. Naive Bayes
2. Decision Tree
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting

# Dataset

### Source-1

The dataset for this problem used with the `demo.py` script is downloaded from here:

```
https://www.kaggle.com/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning
```

This dataset has 83 total columns, 132 of them being symptoms experienced by patiend and last column in prognosis for the same.
